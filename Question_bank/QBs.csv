","Firstly asked about one of my projects. I was asked to explain in detail my project and also tell about the challenges I faced during that project. I was then asked to share screen and show my gfg and leetcode profile.
Then I was asked one of the heap questions from leetcode.
The question was to return a sorted linked list after merging N linked list(all these linked list are sorted).
","The second round began with general introduction where I was asked about my hobbies and interests. Then I was asked about my project and my contribution in it. I was then asked the tech stack i used and a few questions regarding my project. Then on the glider link was shared and I was asked two questions on DSA.

ZS Associates,BTSA,No,,3,"Round 1 had 3 parts: 
Aptitude based mcq round, 
a small case study round also mcq based,
then a video interview round in which questions were presented on the screen and we have to record our video as we answer the questions. The questions were mostly behavioural based and 1 guesstimate was also asked. 
Although you have to go though the entire round in one sitting you can take breaks between the parts if you dont start the next part immediately after completing one part.
Get familiarised with common hr/behavioural questions beforehand as the time to think is very less, only 10 seconds and then the recording starts, so it will be beneficial if you have a structured answer prepared beforehand for common hr questions. 
Also do practice a few guesstimates as you might get one during the video interview and you'll have to explain your approach.","During this round the interviewer asked my introduction, and following that were several questions related to sql and database like primary key, foreign key, difference between truncate and delete. 
I was also asked to write 2 sql queries. 2 tables were given and i had to tell the emp_id values that were present in:- 
1: either of the table, 
2: both the tables. 
I was also asked about one of my project as well during this round. 
Along with these some numerical puzzles and a riddle was also asked.","The interviewer again asked me for my introduction and after that questions regarding my past internship experience were asked. My projects were also discussed in detail. Interviewer also asked about my hobbies and the sports i followed and asked me a guesstimate regarding the same. I was also asked some numerical puzzles in this round as well. 
One situation based question was also asked, as i mentioned i was on the organizing team of a national level hackathon,  interviewer asked me if i have to now take it to an international level how would i manage it.",,"The one sure question you'll be asked in any interview is your introduction, and if you keep it relevant and interesting further questions will be from the things you mentioned while introducing yourself also. You can really make a great impression through just your introduction and set course for rest of your interview. For BTSA profile at ZS i would suggest to solve 10-15 guesstimates and practice sql queries really well. For BTSA profile dont do case studies as case study round is only for DAA and BOA profile."

",There was no round 2.,,"For Aptitude follow RS Aggarwal. 
For DSA, follow GFG. 
For subjects like DBMS and OS, you can refer YouTube or GFG.
For OOPs, refer OOPs using C++ byJoyce Farrell or Sumita Arora C++.

Make your basics clear! You will be most tested on your basics! Try to practice DSA as much as you can from Leetcode or GFG. But be consistent! Solving 2 questions per day is much better than solving 14 questions on weekends. 
Approach to solve a particular problem matters more than the final solution.
Be confident and be interested to know more about the company.

If you still have any doubts, feel free to message me on whatsapp or contact via email. All the best!
